## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Lean Container** (`ghcr.io/quantecon/quantecon-build:latest`)
  - Optimized for CI builds (~3GB vs ~8GB full container)
  - Miniconda + Python 3.13 + Jupyter Book tooling
  - XeLaTeX with essential packages (no full TexLive)
  - Weekly automated builds alongside full container

- **Container Test Workflow** (`.github/workflows/test-container.yml`)
  - Automated validation of both containers after builds
  - XeLaTeX compilation tests
  - Jupyter Book HTML/PDF build tests

- **Lecture Validation Tests** (`.github/workflows/test-containers-lectures.yml`)
  - Full lecture builds against all 4 QuantEcon lecture repositories
  - Tests container's built-in environment (ignores lecture repo's environment.yml)
  - Matrix-based parallel testing across all containers × all repos (2×4 = 8 jobs)
  - Triggered automatically after container builds, or manually via workflow_dispatch
  - 120-minute timeout per build, artifacts retained for debugging
  - Validated: All 4 lecture repos build successfully on both containers

### Changed
- **`setup-environment`** - Now container-aware
  - Auto-detects QuantEcon containers via `/etc/quantecon-container` marker
  - Skips redundant LaTeX installation when running in container
  - Activates pre-installed `quantecon` conda environment in containers
  - Falls back to full setup on `ubuntu-latest` or other runners
  - Added `skip-latex` input for manual control

- **Container Infrastructure**
  - Added Chrome + kaleido for Plotly static image export (`fig.to_image()`)
  - Added Intel MKL for optimized linear algebra (2-3x faster for numerical computations)
  - Added scikit-learn for ML lectures
  - Added DejaVu fonts to both containers for XeLaTeX compatibility
  - Updated lean container to Miniconda py313_25.11.1-1
  - Uses `defaults` channel only (matches Anaconda metapackage behavior)

### Documentation
- Added container marker documentation
- Updated setup-environment README with container detection details

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-03

### Added
- `preview-cloudflare` - Cloudflare Pages deployment for PR previews
  - Works with public and private repositories (free tier supports both)
  - Predictable preview URLs (`pr-{number}.{project}.pages.dev`)
  - Changed lecture detection with direct links in PR comments
  - Smart PR comments (updates existing instead of duplicates)
  - Security-aware (skips forks and dependabot)

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Renamed `deploy-netlify` → `preview-netlify` to better reflect its purpose as a PR preview action (not production deployment)

## [0.1.1] - 2026-01-16

### Changed
- Improved failure logging with clear summary
  - Add prominent error message on build failure
  - Display build configuration summary
  - Provide instructions for downloading execution reports

### Documentation
- Add comprehensive Netlify setup guide
  - CLI-only site creation instructions
  - How to disable duplicate PR comments
  - Decision table for different scenarios

## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-16

### Added
- **Core Actions:**
  - `setup-environment` - Conda/LaTeX/ML environment setup with caching
  - `build-lectures` - Jupyter Book builds with execution caching
  - `deploy-netlify` - PR preview deployment with smart comments
  - `publish-gh-pages` - Native GitHub Pages deployment (OIDC-based)

- **Container Infrastructure** (`ghcr.io/quantecon/quantecon:latest`)
  - Ubuntu 24.04 LTS + TexLive (latest) + Miniconda + Python 3.13
  - Anaconda 2025.12 metapackage (numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, jupyter)
  - Jupyter Book 1.0.4post1 + sphinx extensions
  - Weekly automated builds (Monday 2am UTC)

- **Build Features:**
  - Asset assembly (`html-copy-pdf`, `html-copy-notebooks`)
  - Execution reports on failure
  - GitHub native build cache for fast PR builds
  - Multi-format support (HTML, PDF, Jupyter notebooks)

### Performance
- Container setup: ~2-3 min (vs ~7-8 min ubuntu-latest)
- Conda environment caching (~5-6 min savings)
- Overall: 60-70% faster environment setup
